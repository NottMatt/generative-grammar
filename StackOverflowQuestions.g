<statement>
<statement> <question> ;
<statement> <statement> ;
<statement> however <statement> ;
<statement> but <statement> ;
(This is my first stack overflow post ever, so sorry if there is anything I did wrong or if anything is not clear) ;
I don't get why I have to <goal> ;
I really can't understand what's wrong with the code. ;
I can't actually figure out what I'm doing wrong here. ;
these are not the same. ;
seg fault when trying to <goal> ;
I have two sub-optimal solutions to <goal> . ;
very strange mistake in C when working with <cthing> . ;
debug assertion failed when trying to <goal> . ;
I've tried several things, <statement> ;
I know my methid is wrong as it does not work. ;
I can't see what is causing the seg fault. ;
someone suggested I <goal> . ;
I made a small program that <action> . ;
I need help implementing a <cthing> . ;
my current problem is that <statement> ;
normally I could just <goal> . ;
normally it would just <goal> . ;
I omitted the irrelevant parts of my code. ;
everything seems to work fine, but <statement> ;
I dont think my way is right. ;
this is not the right way to <goal> . ;
as you can see, <statement> ;
I have a question. <question> ;
I'm new to the use of <cthing> . ;
I think I've messed up my <cthing> . ;
I'm pretty new to C, so <statement> ;
I've been trying to <goal> . ;
I keep trying to <goal> . ;
I had this error I couldn't find a solution to. ;
after I wrote this code, <statement> ;
my question is <question> ;
I'm new to programming and <statement> . ;
I come across errors that I can't interpret. ;
sorry for the messy code. ;
I don't understand why. ;
I'm trying to <goal> , <statement> ;
I'm trying to <goal> , But <statement> ;
I don't understand how to <goal> . ;
I don't understand <cthing> . ;
I'm coming from a <language> background and have started working with <cthing> in C++. ;
one thing that occurred to me is that people often use <cthing> rather than the <cthing> . ;
<cthing> in C++ are nothing like they are in <language> . ;
<cthing> are basically just like C++ verison of <cthing> , right? ;
I don't think my <cthing> is working. ;
It would probably be better for me to use <cthing> instead of <cthing> , But <statement> ;
I can't figure out why should we do it this way. ;
I would assume it has to do with <cthing>. ;
my code is working in my PC but I can't <goal> . ;
I keep getting <cthing> errors. ;
